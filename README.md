CodeSprout is a VS Code extension that helps you stay hydrated while coding by gamifying the process with a virtual plant companion.

## Features

- 🌿 **Virtual Plant Companion**: A cute pixel art plant that lives in your VS Code sidebar
- ⏰ **Hydration Reminders**: Gentle reminders to drink water at customizable intervals
- 📈 **Streak Tracking**: Track your hydration habits over time
- 🎮 **Interactive Experience**: Water your plant with a satisfying button click
- 🎨 **Cute Animations**: Enjoy gentle animations that bring your plant to life
- 🧮 **Personalized Water Calculation**: Calculates recommended daily water intake based on your weight (Weight × 35 ml)
- 💧 **Volume-Based Tracking**: Tracks actual water consumption with 250ml per drink
- 📊 **Progress Monitoring**: See your daily progress toward your hydration goal
- 📈 **Historical Reporting**: View weekly hydration trends with interactive charts
- ⚙️ **Customizable Settings**: Easily adjust your height, weight, reminder intervals, and manual water targets

## How It Works

1. Your virtual plant lives in the VS Code sidebar
2. Set your physical stats (height and weight) for personalized hydration goals
3. Set your preferred hydration interval (default: every 45 minutes)
4. When it's time to drink, you'll receive a gentle notification
5. Click "I Drank" to log 250ml of water consumption
6. Track your daily progress and build up your hydration streak!
7. View historical trends in the reporting section

> Note: CodeSprout provides general wellness reminders and is not a medical tool.
